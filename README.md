Getting Started
------

#### Clone the repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/9jaswag/restaurant-reviews.git
```


#### Change directory
```sh
$ cd restaurant-reviews
```

#### Run app
Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has a simple tool to do this. Check the version of Python you have: 
```sh
python -V
```
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with:
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.). For Python 3.x, you can use:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
If you can't be bothered about Python, you can also use [Lite Server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server).
